1. Preparing modules for use with DS brut

* connect via bluetooth (default pin is 1234, though it shouldn't be 
  required)
* send "$$$" (no CR) within the first couple of seconds, should return "CMD" (CRLF)
* send "ST,255" (with CR) to enable continuous configuration, should return "AOK" (CRLF)
* send "SU,57" (with CR) to change default baud rate, should return "AOK"
* send "---" to quit command mode


2. Debugging bluetooth connections

If the LED is blinking the device isn't connected.
