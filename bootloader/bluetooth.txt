1. Preparing modules for use with DS brut

* connect via bluetooth (default pin is 1234, though it shouldn't be 
  required)
* open terminal programm and set baudrate to 115200
* send "$$$" (no CR) within the first couple of seconds, should return "CMD" (CRLF)
* send "ST,255" (with CR) to enable continuous configuration, should return "AOK" (CRLF)
* send "SU,57" (with CR) to change default baud rate, should return "AOK"
* send "SN,dsbluetooth" (with CR) to change the device name
* send "---" to quit command mode

If the LED is blinking (fast, 3 times a second) the device is connected.
