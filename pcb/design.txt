* move drilling at top right a little bit down
* how to cut the plastic cases?

* ds_bluetooth: mosi/miso pads switched
* ds_bluetooth: move gnd via somewhere else
* ds_master/ds_slave: remove one of the headers out?
* ds_bluetooth: maybe move capacitor down a little bit
* ds_bluetooth/ds_gig_master: easier solution for getting power while flashing? (bring reset down to nds connector and use this one?)
* ds_bluetooth: do we really need to isolate the vias below the module? (use finisher?)
* ds_bluetooth: do we really need all resistors at the top?
* ds_bluetooth: make big solder pads for rx/tx hooking, and a way to remove the atmega168 from the line (solder bridge?)
